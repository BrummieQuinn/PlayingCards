# Playing cards with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Task:

Create a poker hand in HTML and CSS.

We were asked to create an animation effect using ```@keyframe``` at-rule

updated 13/06/2023 - 

While learning Javascript I was given the opportunity to add a script to a previous project.

I chose my playing cards as they are the project I'm most proud of at the moment.

- Added Javascript interactivity to the playing cards. 
When clicked cards expand by scale(1.3) which represents 30% where 1.3 is 30% greater than 1

- Added lighthouse report as a JSON file and png - my first perfect score 100!

Inspiration taken from [Selfthinker](https://selfthinker.github.io/CSS-Playing-Cards/), I would never have been able to build my own version of cards.

What they were able to build, really showed me the all the possibilities and really pushed me to try to build something just as cool.

Since web accessibility is a major passion of mine, I'm really happy to have been able to keep to the original idea of building the cards with semantic HTML
